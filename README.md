This purpose of this project is to practice Data Analysis and Engineering at home over a weekend. While major tasks were completed under in a few hours. As a student exploring various forms of data analysis and data engineering to improve my experience, I have found that there is a need for scripting code with creating pipelines for data staging in mind.

Originally I have hard engineered various parts of this project then I have edited the code to improve functionality of the notebook. The main focus of this project is create functions specific to data and such they are useful in the longer run and simulate a data staging pipeline. 

Another topic of data analysis I have focussed on is storage and speed optimization. I have used time module which was not added to data to test the time taken to execute the entire notebook. It took 9.196714401245117 seconds to completely execute the data, given that we are resuing the geographical location data.

Another concept that helped me in this project the Medallion Architecture concept by Databricks and it's definition of how data should behave and be handled in various stages of its lifecycle.
